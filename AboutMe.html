    <u>Biography</u>
    <p>I was Born July 19, 2002 in . I grew up; in florida and transition to Georgie was rough mainly because of all the creepy slopes and the fact we arrived here during one of it's brutally cold winters. I have a dog named Sparky he's a poodle/schnauzer

        I have 6 siblings and 5 of them have star in there name, were all named after our father. I like drawing and personally think I'm pretty good at it. I fumble with my words and have to track them down in mind but sometimes my mind works slowly in all of it's weirdness. As a career I wouldn't mind being a screenwriter, or an artist, and either work with dc or marvel. </p>
