    <u>Biography</u>
    <p>I was Born July 19, 2002 in . I grew up; in florida and transition to Georgie was rough mainly because of all the creepy slopes and the fact we arrived here during one of it's brutally cold winters. I have a dog named Sparky he's a poodle/schnauzer <img src="https://www.instagram.com/p/z3SBE7wcUFFJrWuw4ZsAyKfyviZ4bY7Jp_kng0/?taken-by=create_box&hl=en" alt=""> I have 6 siblings and 5 of them have star in there name, after our father. I like drawing and personally think I'm pretty good at it. I fumble with my words and have to track them down in mind but sometimes my mind works slowly in all of it's weirdness. As a career I wouldn't mind being a screenwriter, or an artist, and either work with dc or marvel. I believe the thing I'm best at is breathing I don't even have to think about it, ha bet you can't do that. </p>
